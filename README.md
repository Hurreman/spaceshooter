# Development (Vite)

Clone repo, run "npm install" followed by "npm run dev" from the root.

# Prod / Build

For a production build/hosting, I've prepared a Dockerfile & Compose-file.
Create an '.env' file in the server directory, containing a HTTP_PORT=<your_port_of_choice> entry, and then:

´docker compose up -d´ 

# Demo

Playable demo (hopefully) up at https://spaceshooter.ddns.net/ :)
